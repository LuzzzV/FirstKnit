# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct punctuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare English class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer
I attended Palmdale High School for my Freshmen and Sophomore year of High School. Since I got pregnant during my Sophmore year I ended up falling behind and missing a lot of credits so I had to finish my Junior and Senior year at R.Rex Parris High School, which actually helped me graduate 2 months earlier then planned. English classes usually involve writing a lot of essays and math involves more problem solving. I used to think math was easier than English because math felt like it came with instructions so it was easier to follow for me. As I take higher math classes, I now realize that English is easier than math for me because it is all one language. 
  

     


## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
  I own an HP Chromebook x360 laptop, it is way faster then the last computer I owned which was a Lenavo. From a scale of 1 to 10, I am honestly close to being a dummy when it comes to computers. I would rate myself a 4.5 out of 10 because I know the basics but that's about it. Since my boyfriend and my son love playing video games, I actually had to purchase fast speed internet so that none of our networks lag ever.
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be? 

### my answer     
  I prefer for my classmates and my instructor to call me by my first name.
